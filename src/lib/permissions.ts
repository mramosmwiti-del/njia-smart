/**
 * Central RBAC config.
 *
 * Rules encoded here:
 * 1. Visibility follows rights: if a role has "none" on a module, it is not
 *    just blocked from acting on it, it should not be rendered/listed either.
 * 2. Ownership gates deletion: a user may only delete a record they created.
 *    Full-access roles can still USE/VIEW everything, but delete requires
 *    either ownership of the record or an admin override.
 * 3. "assigned" access means the user only sees/uses records assigned to
 *    them (not the whole module), on top of whatever "full" modules they have.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth — UI nav, route guards, and
 * component-level checks should all read from here instead of hardcoding
 * role checks, so access rules stay consistent everywhere.
